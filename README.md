# * Population Viability Analysis - GISERA Project *

**Francisco Encinas-Viso - CSIRO**

This project aims to identify critical life-history trait values and environmental factors affecting population viability of different plant groups (Acacia, Eucalipts, grasses and insect-pollinated herbs)
affected by the CSG development in South Queensland using spatially and genetically explicit simulation models. The final goal is to develop basic guidelines for plant population offsetting.

## Files included
Models has been developed in C.
- Spatially and genetically explicit model of a plant population without seedbank.
- Spatially and genetically explicit model of a plant population with seedbank.

## Output files
The output files should include estimations of Log stochastic growth rate and Quasi-extinction threshold (risk curves)
