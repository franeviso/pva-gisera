<p>This project aims to identify critical life-history trait values and environmental factors affecting population viability of different plant groups (Acacia, Eucalipts, grasses and insect-pollinated herbs) affected by the CSG development in South Queensland using spatially and genetically explicit simulation models. The final goal is to develop basic guidelines for plant population offsetting.</p>
<h2 id="files-included">Files included</h2>
<p>Models has been developed in C. - Spatially and genetically explicit model of a plant population without seedbank. - Spatially and genetically explicit model of a plant population with seedbank.</p>
<h2 id="output-files">Output files</h2>
<p>The output files should include estimations of Log stochastic growth rate and Quasi-extinction threshold (risk curves)</p>
